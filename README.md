# Malaria-Incidence
Kaggle is a remarkable web-based, data science resource which contains a a huge number of different data sets and tutorials on tools. (Highly recommended.) One particular data set is the World Health Organisation statistics for 2020. We have downloaded for you data on the incidence of Malaria for a range of countries and done a little pre-processing, mainly to convert real-valued incidence per 1,000 population into integers (because Shell can only handle integer data). Your program should explicitly read from incedenceOfMalaria.csv, which will be placed in the same directory as your program.

Your program should be called malaria_incidence. The program will be given a single argument. If the argument is a year, the program should report the country with the highest incidence and the corresponding incidence value for that year. On the other hand, if the argument is a country, the program should report the year with the highest incidence and the corresponding incidence value. In the case of several hits, do something that would make sense to the user. (Outputs will be assessed by a human, so we can deal with differences.) Finally, as you scan through the list of countries you will notice some that have further information in brackets; the bracketted information can be ignored. Sudan, where there is genuine ambiguity, will not be tested.
